# Description:
Inspired by the BeOS and Haiku operating systems (as well as other retro UIs).
There is an alternate color scheme based on GTK\\\\\\\'s fallback theme that can be uncommented in the gtkrc; it offers more contrast.

GTK+ based on the murrine launchpad theme (version 0.5) & my own Murrina Dreadful. Requires a newish version the murrine engine.

Use whatever window decoration you like.
